# scrabble_project
A simple web-based Scrabble game with React framework for local multiplayer. 

Inspiration was based on the classic Scrabble game that we all grew up with! Originally was doing this for a club event, but wasn't used in the end. 

Features include:
  - Drag-and-drop letter tiles,
  - Word validation (because Scrabble),
  - Score calculator based on different letter combinations

Differences from the original:
  - No timer,
  - No double/triple score multiplier squares,
  - No random letter assignment to each player's racks.
